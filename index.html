        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        
        <p>Hello there! My name is Matthew DePietropolo. I am a software engineer who is ready to help you out with whatever projects you may have. 
           I got in to coding because I have always really enjoyed solving puzzles and problems. I am not afraid to learn new things or look for answers
           to things I may not know. I look forward to helping bring your vision to life. </p>

        <p>I am a student of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp with training and experience in the following web and programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            SQL and more. </p>
