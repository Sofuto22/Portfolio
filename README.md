# Week-two-portfolio

## Description

This project was in order for me to start creating myself a portfolio to use when enterting the job market. This will make it much easier for recruiters and buisnesses to view
all of my current projects and skills that I have. Which in return will make it much easier to promote myself and my work. During making my portfolio I learned a lot about CSS and how to style sections of my html. I went through a lot of tutorials and readings, but I feel I have a lot to learn so I will keep trying to learn more about this stuff.
I also am trying to improve on my notes and such to make my work easier to view for other people and my future self.
